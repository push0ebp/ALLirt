   * The random number generation functions `random', `srandom',
     `setstate' and `initstate', which are also the basis for the
     `rand' and `srand' functions, were written by Earl T. Cohen for
     the University of California at Berkeley and are copyrighted by the
     Regents of the University of California.  They have undergone minor
     changes to fit into the GNU C library and to fit the ISO C
     standard, but the functional code is Berkeley's.

   * The Internet resolver code is taken directly from BIND 4.9.5,
     which is under both the Berkeley copyright above and also:
